1. How many runs equals a win? Estimate this by picking an MLB team from the 2015 season, then calculating (number of games played)/(number of extra inning games). Why does this give you an estimate for run value of a win?

2. How many runs equals a win? Estimate this by picking an MLB team from 2015 season, calculate the team's RS = average (runs scored)/game and RA = average (runs allowed)/game, then use Pythagorean expectation to determine how much RS needs to increase to gain another win.

3. Assume every hitter on a team walks with probability 0.30, hits a home run with probability 0.05 and strikes out with probability 0.65. If they always bat for 9 innings, how many runs per game could this team expect to score?
